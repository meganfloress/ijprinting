Common Causes of Canon Printer Not Printing
-------------------------------------------

Let’s first identify what could be preventing your Canon printer from producing prints:

1️⃣ **Empty or Low Ink Cartridges**  
If your printer is out of ink, or if the cartridges are not seated correctly, it won’t print. Some Canon printers also stop printing when any cartridge is empty — even if you’re trying to print in black only.

2️⃣ **Paper Jams or Misfeeds**  
A jammed piece of paper inside your printer will interrupt printing. Even small scraps left behind can block the paper path.

3️⃣ **Printer Set to Offline Mode**  
If the printer is manually set to ‘Use Printer Offline’, it won’t receive or process print jobs.

4️⃣ **Outdated or Corrupted Printer Drivers**  
Old or faulty printer drivers can cause communication problems between your computer and printer.

5️⃣ **Connection Issues**  
A weak or lost connection (whether via USB, WiFi, or LAN) will prevent successful printing.

6️⃣ **Print Queue Errors**  
If multiple print jobs are stuck in the queue, they can clog the printing system and halt new jobs.

7️⃣ **Incorrect Printer Settings**  
If your Canon printer isn’t set as the default device or has improper print settings selected, it might not print as expected.
